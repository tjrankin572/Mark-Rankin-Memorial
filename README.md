##  Purpose

This website was built as a memento to my Dad, Mark Rankin, who passed away on September 13th, 2022.
Addtionally, it served users by providing clear insutrctions on where & when the memorial serivce would occur.
The passing of my Dad was sudden and incredibly tragic. 
I am incredibly grateful for the positive light he was on me, my family and the many people he encouraged.

## Under the Hood and Why
Gatsby is the main tool of choice when building this website.
Considering I had built two websites preivously using Gatsby, it served my desire to ship this project quickly.

Gatsby has acted as a practical introduction for me in terms of exactly who React Apps function on a high-level.
While I wouldn't say goodbye to Gatsby, this will be my last one for awhile as I simply desire to utilize React more directly.

There was no significant techincal growth I experienced from developing this website, but it never had to be.
I'm proud of this website simply for sake of self-expression. Coding is fantastic on its own, but can also be cathartic when combined with purpose.

## Future of this website.
I may come back to introduce potential enhancements for the websites.

1. Include a page that has several posts showing stories from people who have interacted with my Dad. (Could be from a wordpress site)
2. Improve some of the stylings of the site.
